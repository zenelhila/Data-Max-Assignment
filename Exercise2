Arrays
- data type which is used to store data of the same type.
- linear data structure
- elements can be easily accessed randomly using an array index
- it has a fixed memory location, so insertion and deletion are costly
- static memory allocation - memory is allocated during compile time
- since size is fixed, it is declared at the initialization
- requires less memory

Linked Lists
- data type which is a collection of data of the same type, where the elements are connected by pointers
- linear data structure
- sequentially access, elements cannot be accessed randomly
- insertion and deletion is easy and costless, by using pointers
- dynamic memory allocation - memory is allocated during run time
- the size is not fixed, it can change during execution
- requires a lot of memory for data and pointer
